# kick-off meeting

Planning the first days:

- administrative stuff
- is your computer sufficiently powerful?
- request academic licence for Autodesk, install REVIT
- view the BIM model of the building in Dalux, review errors, visit the building and find if there are more errors 
- get the preliminary IFC file of the building, 
  - use the "more" UNIX command to see how it's formatted, 
  - check you can open it with REVIT, see if you can do simple edits: move a table, add a whiteboard, change the open/close property of a
window
- see if you can open the model XEOKIT. Compare with other libraries if there exists any.
- start to write down interaction scenarios with the building model (who wants to do what, why, how)..
