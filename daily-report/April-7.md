# work done  - 
* Tried to convert the .ifc file to .xkt in a more efficient way using the methods available in the xeokit GitHub repository  - here the result is improved than the previous one.  But need further testing to get a better 3d model -   ## tomorrow I will prepare the document containing the procedure for converting the IFC to XKT (i will include all the methods I used and corresponding results).   # . While checking the source code in one of the methods I found one parameter named the "compression ratio". further study is required to check the possibility of changing the compression ratio.If it is possible to change the compression ratio i believe that we get a better 3d model.  Also, I will send one mail to xeokit and ask about the reason for the issue - in parallel, i try to do other pending works
* created a test program to fetch the data from the given API using the rdflib.js
# work for tomorrow and Monday - 
* Create new vue.js application and integrate the 3d model using the xeokit 
* Identify the room number of one room in the 3d model using the coordinates( using the mouse click point -  Here I think manually we need to give that, for these coordinates these are the room numbers or we need to give the object Id of the things in each room.)
fetch data from the api using the room number
display the room capacity and room description
